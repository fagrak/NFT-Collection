This project is from the LearnWeb3 Sophomore course. The title is "Build an NFT Collection" 

CryptoDevs NFT Collection is an app that allows users to mint unique Crypto Dev NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. The collection consists of 20 unique NFTs and features a whitelist that allows certain users to mint NFTs 5 minutes early before the public sale.

## Features
- 20 unique Crypto Dev NFTs
- Whitelist feature that allows early minting for certain users
- Users can only mint one NFT per transaction
- A website is available for users to visit and mint NFTs

## How to Use
To mint a Crypto Dev NFT, follow these steps:

- Connect your wallet to the NFT Collection dApp
- Check if you are on the whitelist for early minting
- If you are on the whitelist, you can mint one NFT per transaction 5 minutes early before the public sale
- If you are not on the whitelist, you can still mint one NFT per transaction during the public sale
- Visit the NFT Collection website to start minting your Crypto Dev NFTs

## Run the development server:

Open terminal and go `/my-app` directory.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
